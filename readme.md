# 🧠 RPI-Assisted AI Assistant (formerly TARS 3.0)

A modular, plugin-driven AI assistant designed for Raspberry Pi and desktop environments. Inspired by real-world robotics and space exploration, this assistant supports both voice and text interfaces, dynamic plugin management, and powerful LLM-based conversation capabilities.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ⚙️ **Plugin System** — Enable/disable features live via chat commands
- 🧠 **LLM-Powered Brain** — Uses Mistral 7B via Hugging Face API
- 🎙️/⌨️ **Voice & Text Interfaces** — Only one interface active at a time
- 📝 **Memory System** — Logs sessions by date/time for later reference
- 🔍 **Self-Diagnostics** — Reports internal plugin states and errors
- 🌤️ **Real Weather Plugin** — Fetches live weather using your location
- 🗃️ **Modular Codebase** — Easy to extend, modify, and debug

---

## 🛠️ Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
cd <repo-name>
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 🔑 Set up Hugging Face API
Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
HF_TOKEN=your_huggingface_token
MODEL_ID=mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2
```

## 🧩 Plugin Commands

Inside the assistant chat, use:

```
plugin list
plugin enable <plugin_name>
plugin disable <plugin_name>
```

You can paste this directly into your `README.md`. Once you finalize a **new name** (e.g., `NOVA`, `HALPi`, `PiMind`, etc.), I can easily update the branding line at the top for you. Let me know if you'd like suggestions for a final name!
